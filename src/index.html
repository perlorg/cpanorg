     You are not allowed to remove or alter these comments.

     You are not allowed to rename, remove, or add any files
     in your public mirror of CPAN.

     "Public mirror of CPAN" means a site listed in
     the SITES.html and SITES files at the top level of CPAN
     and also listed at the site http://mirrors.cpan.org/.

     You are not allowed to alter any file
     in you public mirror of CPAN
     EXCEPT
     that you can add a short acknowledgement for example
     for your hosting company, company, university, or sponsor,
     into this CPAN top-level index.html by adding a small
     non-animated image and a hyperlink pointing to your organization
     with text like "hosted by", "powered by", or "sponsored by",
     by placing it visually next to the "CPAN master site hosted by
     ..." acknowledgement at the bottom of the page.
     The image used may not be larger than the one used for the master
     site acknowledgement logos.
         (Technical sidenote: if you do add an acknowledgement link,
         please do think of the consequences to your possible downstream
         CPAN mirrors.)
     Altering this index.html in any other way is not allowed.
     Altering any other files is not allowed.

     Adding any advertisements or any revenue-generating material
     is strictly forbidden.

     Similarly, for your public CPAN mirrors "framing" or "wrapping"
     the CPAN web pages into other sites by using e.g. HTML tables
     or frames is not allowed.

     You are allowed to use the files of CPAN to create your own
     web sites and services since we are just a distributor of the files,
     we do not own most of them.  However, you may not call your creations
     "CPAN" or "CPAN mirrors".  You may say that the files are "mirrored
     from CPAN".
