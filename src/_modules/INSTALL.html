<h1>How to install CPAN modules</h1>

<p>
    Here are some recommended approaches to installing modules from CPAN, as
    with much of Perl there are several alternatives.
</p>

<h2>
    Some basics
</h2>
<p>
    Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use <a href=
    "https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs.html">XS</a> (they are written in <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>) so require a
    C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> (it's easy
    to get this setup - don't panic), see your OS of choice below to find out how
    to get the right compiler. Modules may have dependencies on other modules
    (almost always on <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>) and cannot be
    installed without them (or without a specific version of them). It is worth
    throughly reading the documentation for the options below. Many modules on
    CPAN require a somewhat recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above).
</p>

<h2>
    Quick start
</h2>
<p>
    Install <code>cpanm</code> to make installing other modules easier (you'll
    thank us later). You need to type these commands into a <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">Terminal emulator</a>
    (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac">macOS</a>,
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">Win32</a>, <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Linux</a>)
</p>
<pre>
cpan App::cpanminus
</pre>
<p>
    Now install any module you can <a href="./index.html">find</a>.
</p>
<pre>
cpanm Module::Name
</pre>

<h2>
    Tools
</h2>
<p>
    To help you install and manage your modules:
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/release/local-lib">local::lib</a></em> enables
    you to install modules into a specified directory, without requiring root
    or administrator access. See the <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib#The-bootstrapping-technique">
    bootstrapping technique</a> for how to get started. You can create a
    directory per user/project/company and deploy to other servers, by copying the directory
    (as long as you are on the same operating system and perl version).
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm">cpanm</a></em> from
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus">App::cpanminus</a> is
    a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN. It's
    dependency free (can bootstrap itself) and requires zero configuration
    (<a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#INSTALLATION">install
    instructions</a>). It automates the entire build process for the majority
    of modules on CPAN and works well with <em>local::lib</em> and
    <em>perlbrew</em>. Many experienced Perl developers use this as their tool
    of choice. Related tools: <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/cpan-outdated/script/cpan-outdated">cpan-outdated</a>,
    <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-pmuninstall/bin/pm-uninstall">pm-uninstall</a>,
    <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/cpan-listchanges/script/cpan-listchanges">cpan-listchanges</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-perlbrew/bin/perlbrew">perlbrew</a></em>
    from <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-perlbrew">App::perlbrew</a>
    is useful if your system perl is too old to support modern CPAN modules, or
    if it's troublesome in other capacities (RedHat/CentOS are included in this
    list). perlbrew makes the process of installing a Perl in any directory
    much easier, so that you can work completely independently of any system
    Perl without needing root or administrator privileges. You can use multiple
    versions of Perl (maybe as you upgrade) across different projects. The
    separation from your system Perl makes server maintenance much easier and
    you more confident about how your project is setup. Currently
    Windows is not supported.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/CPAN/scripts/cpan">cpan</a></em>
    from <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN">CPAN</a> has been
    distributed with Perl since 1997 (5.004). It has many more options than
    <em>cpanm</em>, it is also much more verbose.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/CPANPLUS/bin/cpanp">cpanp</a></em>
    from <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/CPANPLUS">CPANPLUS</a> had been
    distributed with Perl since 5.10 (2007) until 5.20 (2014). This offers even more options
    than <em>cpanm</em> or <em>cpan</em> and can be installed just like cpanminus.
</p>



<h2>
    Perl on Windows (Win32 and Win64)
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> is an open source
    binary distribution of Perl for the Windows operating system. It includes a
    compiler and pre-installed modules that offer the ability to install XS
    CPAN modules directly from CPAN. It also comes with lots of modules
    pre-installed, including <em>cpanm</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">ActiveState</a>
    provide a binary distribution of Perl (for many platforms), as well as their
    own <a href="https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/ppm-perl-modules">perl
    package manager</a> (ppm). Some modules are not available as ppm's
    or have reported errors on the ppm build system, this does not mean
    they do not work. You can use the <em>cpan</em> script to build modules
    from CPAN against ActiveState Perl.
</p>

<h2>Perl on macOS</h2>

<p>
    macOS comes with Perl pre-installed. in order to build and install your
    own modules you will need to install the "Command Line Tools for XCode"
    or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> package -
    details on our <a href="../ports/binaries.html#macos">
    ports page</a>.
    Once you have done this you can use all of the tools mentioned above.
</p>

<h2>Perl on other Unix like OSs</h2>
<p>
    Install 'make' through your package manager. You can then
    use all of the tools mentioned above.
</p>

<h2>
    Other tools
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Mini/">CPAN::Mini</a> can provide
    you with a minimal mirror of <a href="https://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> (just
    the latest version of all modules). This makes working offline easy.
</p>
<p>
    <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Mini-Inject/">CPAN::Mini::Inject</a>
    allows you to add your own modules to your local CPAN::Mini mirror of CPAN.
    So you can install and deploy your own modules through the same tools you
    use for CPAN modules.
</p>

<h2>
    Which modules should I use?
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Task-Kensho">Task::Kensho</a> lists
    suggested best practice modules for a wide range of tasks. <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org//">https://metacpan.org/</a> will let you search
    CPAN. You could also get involved with the <a href=
    "https://www.perl.org/community.html">community</a>, ask on a <a href=
    "https://lists.perl.org">mailing list</a> or find your nearest <a href=
    "https://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> group.
