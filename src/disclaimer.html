<h1>CPAN: Disclaimer</h1>

<p>
I make no warranties, implied or otherwise, about the suitability of
the software contained within CPAN. I shall not in any case be liable
for special, incidental, consequential, indirect or other similar
damages arising from the transfer, storage, or use of the material
stored herein.
</p>

<p>
I maintain CPAN completely for free as a service to the Perl
community.  What I do is just pull together various Perl resources of
the Internet. I do not meticulously inspect every file arriving to
CPAN.  Of course I will be very interested to hear if some file
contains nasties like Trojan horses and/or virii, but I take no
responsibility for the contents of CPAN or what they might do.  After
all, how could I protect you from yourself if you decide to do
<code>system("rm -rf /")</code> as root? Against stupidity even the
gods themselves contend in vain.

</p><p>
If you plan to do something commercial out of CPAN such as put it on a
CD-ROM disk, stop right there and think for a moment.  I cannot give
you the permission.  Larry Wall cannot give you the permission.  There
is no single entity on this planet that can give you the permission.
Legally there is no other way than to ask separately from each and
every author of all the separate pieces of software and documentation
in CPAN. No, I do not maintain a list of these authors nor do I intend
to.  Nobody does and nobody can.  I am not stopping you from making a
CD-ROM, I am just reminding you.
</p>

<p>
No doubt these short documents raise more questions than they answer.
Please do not hesitate to contact me and point out where I could do better.
