<h1>
    How to mirror CPAN
</h1>
<p>
    There are several ways to mirror CPAN depending upon what you want to
    achieve.
</p>

<h2>
    How do I create a private or offline mirror?
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/CPAN-Mini/bin/minicpan">minicpan</a>
    from <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Mini">CPAN::Mini</a> is the
    best tool for this. Also look at <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Mini-Inject">CPAN::Mini::Inject</a>
    which allows you to add your own modules into your private mirror.
</p>


<h2>
    Requirements for a full / public mirror
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Good internet connectivity
    </li>
    <li>Around 1GB of storage space for just the current modules.
    </li>
    <li>Around [%
      cpan_gb = cpan_stats.disk_usage.gb;
      cpan_gb = cpan_gb.remove('\..*');
      cpan_gb = cpan_gb + 2;
      cpan_gb %]GB of storage space for the full mirror.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It's highly recommended that you also subscribe to the announcements-only
   <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.mirrors">cpan-mirrors
   mailing list</a> by emailing cpan-mirrors-subscribe at perl.org.
</p>

<h2>
    Tools
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Mini">CPAN::Mini</a> provides
    you with a minimal mirror of <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> (the
    latest version of all modules). This makes working offline easy, it is the
    best tool if you are running a private mirror.
</p>
<p>
    <em>New:</em> <a href="#Instant_mirroring">rrr-client</a> allows
    instant mirroring, and should be used on official public mirrors where
    possible. See instant mirroring <a href=
    "#Instant_mirroring">instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> is the best tool if you need to
    mirror the whole of CPAN or if you are providing a public mirror. Rsync
    <a href="#rsync">Instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Only use FTP if these other methods are absolutely impossible. Never mirror
    with HTTP - you will end up with a million duplicate files in tens of
    gigabytes.
</p>

<h2>
    Which CPAN Mirror should I use?
</h2>

<p>
    You can find your nearest rsync enabled site on <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>, or use
    <a href="http://www.cpan.org/indices/mirrors.json">mirrors.json</a>
    especially if you are building a tool which lets the user select a mirror.
</p>

<p>
    You can also sync from <code>rsync://cpan-rsync.perl.org/CPAN/</code> (the
    "tier 1 mirrors"), though you currently might get better
    performance from a "local" mirror.
</p>

<h2>
    <a name="rsync" id="rsync">Using rsync</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Please limit to once or twice a day. For more frequent updates please see
    <a href="#Instant_mirroring">Instant mirroring</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>On Unix systems</em>
</p>
<pre>
/usr/bin/rsync -av --delete cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/
</pre>
<p>
    Using 'crontab' you can make rsync run once a day, for example<br>
    <tt>40 4 * * * sleep $(expr $RANDOM \% 7200); /usr/bin/rsync -a --delete
    cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/</tt><br>
    The "sleep $(...);" statement makes the command delay up to 2 hours before
    running rsync; the advantage of this is that you (and everybody else) won't
    access the mirror at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you are mirroring to an SSD you might get timeouts using --delete-after
    when many symlinks are being purged. Using --delete will work properly.
</p>
<p>
    If you have a problem with permissions (files are created with mode
    <tt>-rw-------</tt>), set <tt>umask</tt> in your cronjob :<br>
    <tt>40 4 * * * umask 022 ; sleep ... ; /usr/bin/rsync ...</tt><br>
    The <tt>umask 022</tt> allows rsync to set proper permissions for
    files and directories.
</p>
<p>
    <em>On Windows systems</em>
</p>
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Rsync\rsync -av --delete cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/
</pre>
<p>
    Using the 'AT' tool, you can schedule rsync to run daily, for example:<br>
    <tt>AT 20:00 /every:M,T,W,Th,F,S,Su "C:\Program Files\Rsync\rsync -a
    --delete cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/"</tt><br>
</p>

    How do I create a public mirror?

<p>
    "Instant mirroring" keeps your CPAN mirror up-to-date by continuously
    tracking the CPAN master; picking up the changes from the master, a short
    time (minutes) after they occur.
</p>
<p>
    Instant mirroring is used for all Tier 1 mirrors (so
    cpan-rsync.perl.org stays in sync across mirrors).
</p>
<p>
    To use "instant mirroring", you need a special client: "rrr-client" or
    "iim".
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/File-Rsync-Mirror-Recent/bin/rrr-client">"rrr-client"</a> is part of the <a href=
    "https://metacpan.org/release/File-Rsync-Mirror-Recent">File::Rsync::Mirror::Recent</a>
    (also known as <code>rrr</code>) package ; it is the official client, used
    on the CPAN master to get updates from <a href=
    "http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a> : the true heart and soul of "all things
    perl", see the <a href=
    "https://github.com/perlorg/cpanorg/wiki/Instant-update-mirroring">setup
    guide</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://svn.science.uu.nl/repos/sci.penni101.iim/trunk/iim.html">"iim"</a> is an
    alternative for "rrr-client" ; basically it does the same thing, but it is
    more efficient (on start-up) and has some features that may be helpful to
    CPAN mirror operators.
</p>
