    <a name="What_is_Perl" id="What_is_Perl">What is Perl?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    From the Perl documentation:
</p>
<p>
    <cite>Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic heritage
    written by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands. It derives from the
    ubiquitous C programming language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk, the
    Unix shell, and at least a dozen other tools and languages. Perl's process,
    file, and text manipulation facilities make it particularly well-suited for
    tasks involving quick prototyping, system utilities, software tools, system
    management tasks, database access, graphical programming, networking, and
    web programming. These strengths make it especially popular with
    system administrators and web developers, but mathematicians,
    geneticists, journalists, and even managers also use Perl. Maybe you
    should, too.</cite>

<h3>
    <a name="What_is_Perl6" id="What_is_Perl6">What is Perl6?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Perl 5 and Perl 6 are two languages in the Perl family, but of different 
    lineages. Perl 6 is not a replacement for Perl 5, it is also not 
    currently production ready.

<h3>
    <a name="What_is_CPAN" id="What_is_CPAN">What is CPAN?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    CPAN is the <b>C</b>omprehensive <b>P</b>erl <b>A</b>rchive <b>N</b>etwork,
    a large collection of Perl software and documentation. You can begin
    exploring from either <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> or any of the mirrors
    listed at <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
    CPAN is also the name of a Perl module, CPAN.pm, which is used to
    download and install Perl software from the CPAN archive. This FAQ covers
    only a little about the CPAN module and you may find the documentation for
    it by using <tt>perldoc CPAN</tt> via the command line or on the web at
    <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/lib/CPAN.pm">http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/lib/CPAN.pm</a>.

<h3>
    <a name="What_is_PAUSE" id="What_is_PAUSE">What is PAUSE?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://pause.cpan.org/">PAUSE</a> is the <b>P</b>erl
    <b>A</b>uthors <b>U</b>pload <b>SE</b>rver, a registry for Perl module,
    script and documentation authors to upload their work to the CPAN. CPAN and
    PAUSE are often used interchangeably but they are distinct from each other.
    The CPAN.pm documentation explains it rather simply;
</p>
<p>
    <cite>In this discussion CPAN and PAUSE have become equal -- but they are
    not. PAUSE is authors/, modules/ and scripts/. CPAN is PAUSE plus the
    clpa/, doc/, misc/, ports/ and src/.</cite>
</p>
<p>
    See the question <a href="#How_contribute_modules">'How do I contribute
    modules?'</a> below if you want to become a registered PAUSE user.

<h3>
    <a name="How_does_the_CPAN_work" id="How_does_the_CPAN_work">How does the
    CPAN work?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    CPAN works with the generosity and cooperation of thousands of developers,
    over [% cpan_stats.mirrors.count %] participating mirrors, many companies,
    institutions and individuals donating the network bandwidth, storage space
    and computing power, volunteers who help keep everything together and users
    whose interest in Perl keep the archive alive and growing.
</p>
<p>
    After an author uploads their module to <a href=
    "http://pause.cpan.org/">PAUSE</a>, it will be mirrored to CPAN once an
    hour and from there, to the rest of the mirrors around the world. There are
    people who advise authors on their choice of name and namespace for their
    modules and a few others who answer questions and investigate issues sent
    to cpan@perl.org.

<h3>

<h3>
    <a name="Where_older_Perl" id="Where_older_Perl">Where can I find
    older/obsolete versions of Perl or Perl Modules?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Unless you have A Very Good Reason you shouldn't be installing obsolete
    versions because they might contain bugs, possibly even security bugs.
</p>
<p>
    Good Reasons may include having to support Perl 4 programs, trying to
    replicate a bug that requires an old Perl release, or pure joy of software
    archaeology. (Are you Perl 1 compliant?)
</p>
<p>
    CPAN does not carry all ancient releases and patchlevels of Perl (because
    of the bugs we mentioned above and because they would take quite a lot of
    storage space).

<h3>
    <a name="What_versions_mean" id="What_versions_mean">How do I interpret the
    Perl version numbers?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Perl changed the version numbering system with v5.6.0 as was indicated in
    the release announcement:
</p>
<p>
    <cite>Perl v5.6.0 is a major release that incorporates all maintenance and
    development changes since the last major release, 5.005. As you may have
    noticed, the version numbering has changed. Releases will henceforth be
    numbered as revision.version.subversion triples. Maintenance releases will
    have an even version component, while the version component for development
    releases will be odd. For example, the next maintenance update of Perl
    5.6.0 will be v5.6.1, and the development series will begin life at
    v5.7.0.</cite>
</p>
<p>
    You may also peruse the <tt>perlhist</tt> manpage for a complete list of
    versions and their release dates.

<h3>
    <a name="How_install_Perl_source" id="How_install_Perl_source">How do I
    install Perl using the source code?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    To build Perl you need a C compilation environment. After downloading the
    source code and opening it up, you should first read the INSTALL document
    which will detail how to build Perl on most systems. There are a number of
    README.[platform] for platforms where special care is needed in building
    Perl. As always, reading the documentation is a Good Thing[tm].
</p>
<p>
    Perl can be installed using the standard source code distribution on almost
    all platforms Perl runs on. This includes all the UNIXes (and good
    lookalikes, meaning POSIX environments like OS/2, Plan 9, QNX, Amiga,
    MPE/iX, VMS, OS390, Stratus VOS), and Microsoft platforms. The most notable
    exceptions are (as of 1999-Mar-24);
</p>
<ul>
    <li>MacOS (1)
    </li>
    <li>AS/400 (2)
    </li>
    <li>Novell Netware (2)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For these platforms a binary release may be the easiest path.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The source code to compile MacPerl is available at <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/ports/mac/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/mac/</a>.
    </li>
    <li>The source code for AS/400 and Netware Perls have not been merged to
    the main Perl source code distribution. If you want to try compiling them
    yourself, get the sources from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/as400/">
        http://www.cpan.org/ports/As400/</a> or <a href=
        "http://www.cpan.org/ports/netware/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/netware/</a>

<h3>
    <a name="How_install_Perl_modules" id="How_install_Perl_modules">How do I
    install Perl modules?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Installing a new module can be as simple as typing <tt>perl -MCPAN -e
    'install Chocolate::Belgian'</tt>. The <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/cpan.html">CPAN.pm documentation</a> has more
    complete instructions on how to use this convenient tool. If you are
    uncomfortable with having something take that much control over your
    software installation, or it otherwise doesn't work for you, the <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmodinstall.html">perlmodinstall</a>
    documentation covers module installation for UNIX, Windows and Macintosh in
    more familiar terms.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, if you're using ActivePerl on Windows, the <a href=
    "http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/ppm-perl-modules">PPM</a> (Perl
    Package Manager) has much of the same functionality as CPAN.pm.

            Each time a module is installed on your system, it appends
            information like the following to a file called
            <tt>perllocal.pod</tt> which can be found in
            <tt>/usr/local/lib/perl5/version number/architecture/</tt> or
            something akin to that. The path for your specific installation is
            in your @INC which you can divine with <tt>perl -V</tt>.

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide  
or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of 
a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.

<p>
    Many CPAN filenames end in .tar.gz. Unfortunately some programs mutilate
    such names (e.g., rename them with _tar.tar) so that unpacking programs
    don't recognise them and refuse to unpack them. Try saving the file using
    the .tgz suffix or try changing your web client. Also, you could try a
    plain FTP client as almost all the CPAN sites are ftp-reachable. You can
    find the full list of mirrors <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>

    Please read <a href=

    sure what the files should be unpacked with and want to know if you are
    using the right program.
</p>
<p>
    If you still think you have a corrupt file, try downloading the file from
    another site. If you still have no satisfaction, then please let us know
    the exact file name and URL/FTP site and path.

    We at CPAN are not a helpdesk. We may point you towards a plethora of

    In addition to the on-line documentation you might try the newsgroup

<p>
    Always remember to make your bug reports as detailed as possible. "Perl
    doesn't work." is not a bug report.<br>
    Please note that problems concerning modules that are installed separately
    from the Perl distribution (such as Tk) are reported differently.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a checklist from <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlbug.html">perlbug</a>, a bug reporting tool
    included in your Perl distribution. It is a bit on the long side, but
    please read it carefully as the better your bug report is, the more likely
    the issue will be addressed.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>What version of Perl you are running?</b>
        <p>
            Try <tt>perl -v</tt> at the command line to find out.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Are you running the latest released version of perl?</b>
        <p>
            Look at <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub">http://www.perl.com/</a>
            to find out. If it is not the latest released version, get that one
            and see whether your bug has been fixed. Note that bug reports
            about old versions of Perl, especially those prior to the 5.0
            release, are less likely to be incorporated into the source as
            Perl1 through Perl4 are largely unmaintained.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Are you sure what you have is a bug?</b>
        <p>
            A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be
            documented features in Perl. Make sure the behavior you are
            witnessing doesn't fall under that category, by glancing through
            the <a href="http://perldoc.cpan.org">documentation</a> that comes
            with Perl (we'll admit this is no small task, given the sheer
            volume of it all, but at least have a look at the sections that
            seem relevant).
        </p>
        <p>
            Be aware of the familiar traps that perl programmers of various
            hues fall into. See the <a href=
            "http://perldoc.perl.org/perltrap.html">perltrap</a> documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check in <a href=
            "http://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag.html">perldiag</a> to see what
            any Perl error message(s) mean. If message isn't in perldiag, it
            probably isn't generated by Perl. Consult your operating system
            documentation instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are on a non-UNIX platform check also <a href=
            "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlport.html">perlport</a> documentation,
            some features may not be implemented or work differently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to study the problem under the Perl debugger,if necessary. See
            the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebug.html">perldebug</a>
            documentation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Do you have a proper test case?</b>
        <p>
            The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be
            fixed, because if no one can duplicate the problem, no one can fix
            it. A good test case has most of these attributes: fewest possible
            number of lines; few dependencies on external commands, modules, or
            libraries; runs on most platforms unimpeded; and is
            self-documenting.
        </p>
        <p>
            A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be on the
            perl test suite. If you have the time, consider making your test
            case so that it will readily fit into the standard test suite.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember also to include all the exact error messages, if any.
            "Perl complained something" is not an exact error message.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
            (dbx, gdb, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the bug
            report. NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
            (often -g), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use
            because it will most probably contain only the function names and
            not their arguments. If possible, recompile your Perl with debug
            info and reproduce the dump and the stack trace.
        </p>

        <b>Can you describe the bug in plain English?</b>
        <p>
            The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely
            it will be fixed. Anything you can provide by way of insight into
            the problem helps a great deal. In other words, try to analyze the
            problem (to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Can you fix the bug yourself?</b>
        <p>
            A bug report which includes a patch to fix it will almost
            definitely be fixed. Use the diff program to generate your patches
            (diff is being maintained by the GNU folks as part of the diffutils
            package, so you should be able to get it from any of the GNU
            software repositories). If you do submit a patch, the cool-dude
            counter at perlbug@perl.com will register you as a savior of the
            world. Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or
            requests for more detailed explanations about your fix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some clues for creating quality patches:<br>
            Use the -c or -u switches to the diff program (to create a
            so-called context or unified diff). Make sure the patch is not
            reversed (the first argument to diff is typically the original
            file, the second argument your changed file). Make sure you test
            your patch by applying it with the patch program before you send it
            on its way. Try to follow the same style as the code you are trying
            to patch. Make sure your patch really does work (make test, if the
            thing you're patching supports it).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Can you use perlbug to submit the report?</b>
        <p>
            perlbug will, amongst other things, ensure your report includes
            crucial information about your version of perl. If perlbug is
            unable to mail your report after you have typed it in, you may have
            to compose the message yourself, add the output produced by perlbug
            -d and email it to perlbug@perl.com. If, for some reason, you
            cannot run perlbug at all on your system, be sure to include the
            entire output produced by running perl -V (note the uppercase V).
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you use perlbug or send the email manually, please make
            your Subject line informative. "a bug" is not informative. Neither
            is "perl crashes" nor "HELP!!!" These don't help. A compact
            description of what's wrong is fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the
            bug is in your code, or even to get no reply at all. The Perl
            maintainers are busy folks, so if your problem is a small one or if
            it is difficult to understand or already known, they may not
            respond with a personal reply. If it is important to you that your
            bug be fixed, do monitor the Changes file in any development
            releases since the time you submitted the bug, and encourage the
            maintainers with kind words (but never any flames!). Feel free to
            resend your bug report if the next released version of perl comes
            out and your bug is still present.

<h3>
    <a name="How_report_bug_module" id="How_report_bug_module">How do I
    report/fix a bug in a module/script?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Please contact the author of the module/script, ideally by
    creating a ticket using the bug tracker for the module (linked as 'Bugs' from
    <a href="http://www.metacpan.org">www.metacpan.org</a> or 'View/Report Bugs'
    from <a href="http://search.cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a>).
    The author should be automatically notified by email.
</p>
<p>
    If the author doesn't respond, the documentation of the module/script might
    contain a contact address or you can try <tt>CPANID@perl.org</tt> where
    CPANID is the authors CPANID.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the checklist in <a href="#How_report_bug_Perl">reporting bugs in
    Perl</a> above applies for modules as well. Make your bug report as good as
    possible if you really want the bug fixed. If the module is included with
    the Perl distribution you should also follow the Perl bug reporting tips.
</p>

<h3>
    <a name="How_maintain_module" id="How_maintain_module">How do I go about
    maintaining a module when the author is unresponsive?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes a module goes unmaintained for a while due to the author pursuing
    other interests, being busy, etc. and another person needs changes applied
    to that module and may become frustrated when their bug reports and emails
    goes unanswered.
    CPAN does not mediate or dictate a policy in this situation and rely on the
    respective authors to work out the details. If you treat other authors as
    you would like to be treated in the same situation the manner in which you
    go about dealing with such problems should be obvious.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be courteous.
    </li>
    <li>Be considerate.
    </li>
    <li>Make an earnest attempt to contact the author as explained in
    <a href="#How_report_bug_module">How do I report/fix a bug in a
    module/script?</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Give it time. If you need changes made immediately, consider applying
    your patches to the current module, changing the version and requiring that
    version for your application. Eventually the author will turn up and apply
    your patches, offer you maintenance of the module or, if the author doesn't
    respond in a year, you may get maintenance by having interest.
    </li>
    <li>If you need changes in order for another module or application to work,
    consider making the needed changes and bundling the new version with your
    own distribution and noting the change well in the documentation. Do not
    upload the new version under the same namespace to CPAN until the matter
    has been resolved with the author or CPAN.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Simply keep in mind that you are dealing with a person who invested time
    and care into something. A little respect and courtesy go a long way.

<h3>
    <a name="How_adopt_module" id="How_adopt_module">How do I adopt or take
    over a module already on CPAN?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The easiest way to take over a module is to have the current module
    maintainer either make you a co-maintainer or transfer the module to you.
</p>
<p>
    If you can't reach the author for some reason (e.g. email bounces), the
    PAUSE admins at modules@perl.org can help. The PAUSE admins treat each case
    individually.
</p>
<p>
    Please make sure you have tried all of the above ways of getting in contact
    with the author before going this way!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get a login for the Perl Authors Upload Server (PAUSE) if you don't
    already have one: http://pause.perl.org
    </li>
    <li>Write to modules@perl.org explaining what you did to contact the
    current maintainer including all email addresses of the author in cc
    and links to the tickets you have opened.
    The PAUSE admins will also try to reach the maintainer.
    </li>
    <li>Post a public message in a heavily trafficked site announcing your
    intention to take over the module. Potential places are
    http://blogs.perl.org/, http://www.perlmonks.org/, and any appropriate
    mailing lists or web forums.
    </li>
    <li>Wait a bit. The PAUSE admins don't want to act too quickly in case the
    current maintainer is on holiday. If there's no response to private
    communication or the public post, a PAUSE admin can transfer it to you.
    </li>

<p>
    Yes, through the diligence of Paul Schinder and a few others, we have
    <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a> which is a collection
    of test results for modules on a number of different platforms. This
    information is also available when viewing module information on
