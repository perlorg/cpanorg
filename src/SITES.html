<h1>
    CPAN Mirror Network
</h1>
<p>
    For many years, CPAN benefitted from the mirroring of the central
    respository to many sites around the world.  In the time of a slower
    global Internet, these mirrors provided most Perl users with fast access to
    thousands of software distributions.  These days, the CPAN is backed by a
    CDN that performs the same job, but transparently.  There is no longer a
    list of registered mirrors, you can just point at <tt>www.cpan.org</tt> and go.
</p>
<p>To reconfigure the cpan client to remove old mirrors:</p>
<pre>
    o conf urllist www.cpan.org
    o conf commit
</pre>
<h2>
    Thank You
</h2>
<p>
    We would like to thank all of the mirrors who, throughout the years, made
    the CPAN possible, and who helped provide this invaluable resource to the
    Perl community.
</p>
<p>
    The master CPAN site is hosted by <a href=
    "https://www.netactuate.com/">NetActuate</a> in Los Angeles, California.
